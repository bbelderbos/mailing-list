Books I am consuming:

1) Programming
[Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Ramalho/dp/1491946008/): a must read to write more concise, Pythonic code.

2) Non-programming:
[Ego is the Enemy](https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818). Interesting read: why ego stands in the way, and why being humble goes a long way. The audiobook is nicely priced at $ 5.43!

3) Non-programming II:
[The inevitable](https://www.amazon.com/Inevitable-Understanding-Technological-Forces-Future/dp/0525428089/): interested what will shape the technological future? Consume this (audio)book!
